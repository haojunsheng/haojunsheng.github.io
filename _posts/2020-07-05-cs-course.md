In many cases we can give completely rigorous answers; in other cases, these questions have become major open problems in computer science and mathematics. By the end of this course, students will be able to classify computational problems in terms of their computational complexity (Is the problem regular? Not regular? Decidable? Recognizable? Neither? Solvable in P? NP-complete? PSPACE-complete?, etc.). Students will gain a deeper appreciation for some of the fundamental issues in computing that are independent of trends of technology, such as the Church-Turing Thesis and the P versus NP problem.

Mathematical programming relaxations of integer programming formulations are a popular way to apply convex optimization techniques to hard combinatorial optimization problems. Such relaxations can be made closer to their integer programming counterparts by adding constraints; a systematic way to achieve this is via hierarchies of relaxations. Several such hierarchies are well-studied in the literature: Lovasz-Schrijver, Sherali-Adams and the Parrilo-Lasserre sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy. Recently, these hierarchies have received a lot of attention due to their potential to make progress on long standing algorithmic questions, and connections to various other areas such as computational complexity, combinatorial and polynomial optimization, quantum computing, proof complexity and so on. In this course we will cover recent research results in this area for problems arising from optimization, machine learning, computational complexity and more, discussing both lower and upper bounds.

**CS 421. Designing AI to Cultivate Human Well-Being. 2 Units.**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to drive us towards a better future for all of humanity, but it also comes with significant risks and challenges. At its best, AI can help humans mitigate climate change, diagnose and treat diseases more effectively, enhance learning, and improve access to capital throughout the world. But it also has the potential to exacerbate human biases, destroy trust in information flow, displace entire industries, and amplify inequality throughout the world. We have arrived at a pivotal moment in the development of the technology in which we must establish a foundation for how we will design AI to capture the positive potential and mitigate the negative risks. To do this, we must be intentional about human-centered design because, ¿Only once we have thought hard about what sort of future we want, will we be able to begin steering a course toward a desirable future. If we don¿t know what we want, we¿re unlikely to get it.¿ Thus, building AI must be an inclusive, interactive, and introspective process guided by an affirmative vision of a beneficial AI-future. The goal of this interdisciplinary class is to bridge the gap between technological and societal objectives: How do we design AI to promote human well-being? The ultimate aim is to provide tools and frameworks to build a more harmonious human society based on cooperation toward a shared vision. Thus, students are trained in basic science to understand what brings about the conditions for human flourishing and will create meaningful AI technologies that aligns with the PACE framework: Has a clear and meaningful purpose, augments human dignity and autonomy, creates a feeling of inclusivity and collaboration, creates shared prosperity and a sense of forward movement (excellence). Toward this end, students work in interdisciplinary teams on a final project and propose a solution that tackles a significant societal challenge by leveraging technology and frameworks on human thriving.
